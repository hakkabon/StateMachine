	• no correct typeinfo available on runtime object
	• struct Transition destructor is not executed as it should
(2011-04-20)
	• only execute init() in leaf state?
	• event attached to transitions are not unique,
	  is that a problem? transition search starts at active state 
(2011-04-22)
	• redesigned definition of transition, hopefully more 
	  declarative
	• added Trigger, Guard, Action parameters to transition
(2011-04-23)
	• added basic support for threading
	• investigating Fibers, which may be much better to use
